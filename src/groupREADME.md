##Wins:
A consistent win would be the limitation of merge conflicts. Each member created their own test, their own class, and then their own HTML Page. We would organize our work flow through daily standup's and as we merged we  minimized the possibilities of major merge conflicts. Our second major win was with the retrieval of our api data and allowing it to be accessible outside of the .then promise data trap. 

##Challenges:
The greatest challenges were...

1. The ability to access api data after the promise was resolved. 
2. The ability for functions to be on page load and how that interacts with Api retrieval. 
3. Group scheduling across time zones.
4. Making sure commits seemed balanced. 
Future Features:
1. more user friendly interface.
2. featured recipe on home page load
3. welcome user on home page or a page prior to welcome a user to the site
4. 
##Possible additions.
more functionality to the search bar, type partial words and the recipes containing string overlap will render. 
additional filter options as part of the front page spec.
